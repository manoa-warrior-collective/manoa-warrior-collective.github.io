## The Rundown

The Mānoa Warrior Collective presents Rainbow Reclamation: a projected web application designed to be a virtual lost and found for Mānoa students.

### Goals

Nothing is lost forever. We're here to prove that. Rainbow Reclamation is projected to be an all in one virtual lost and found client. Students, faculty, and staff all have much more important things to worry about (like what flavor of cup noodles will be for dinner) than lost property.

To save you an extra trip to the DMV for that dang ID you lost, the next section will detail how we intend on safekeeping lost items.

## Projected Features

Rainbow Reclamation will be designed to initially only have offical postings from the Manoa lost and found for security reasons. As the project grows, a verification system for user submitted lost goods will be explored.

User features:

- Landing page (Shows most recent listings)

![Landing Page Top](images/mockups/landingTop.png)
![Landing Page Bottom](images/mockups/landingBottom.png)

- Profile page (User)
  - Should contain basic student info (Name and department)
- Create Missing Poster
  - Users can create requests to locate lost items
  - Option to offer reqard (future/beyond the basics)
- "Bounty" board
  - Requests for locates will appear here

Admin features:

- Landing Page (Admin control panel)
- Profile Page (Admin)
  - Stands apart from a user profile
  - Should contain Organization/staff name and affilation
- Create Posting
  - Will allow admins to list identifiers, last location seen, and a discussion pool for tips(?)
  - Interactive map with reported locations (future/beyond the basics)
- and more
